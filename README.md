 ## Description

 https://utah-real-estate-keywords-production.up.railway.app/
  The Division of Real Estate Investigators currently do not have an easy way to find the laws that they very frequently have to cite in their Reports. So much time is wasted looking for the correct law, that I was motivated to create something to help speed and accuracy for the Division Investigators. 
 
 Once the Keywords are determined and added to the website, all the Investigators will be able to access the sections and citations associated with the keywords and add them to their reports.  
 We learned SO many things. React, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Models, Schemas OH MY! Seeding a Database this large and specific was a challenge, I think we rewrote the JSON and Models 5 times before we understood the proper structure to return what we wanted.
 Our project standsout as the only one of it's kind in Utah. 
 The structure of the law is not conducive to an easy structure of coding! The laws are often written in differing structures between the sections. 
 We would like to add a way for the user, once logged in, to add a law to the database, complete with section and citation.
